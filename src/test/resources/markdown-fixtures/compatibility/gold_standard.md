Time in the Machine – A Category Mistake

What we are running into is a category mistake about time that Krieg (and Elul behind him) is deliberately exploiting.

- time as ordering device
- time as experienced flow

2. Time as ordering device (machine time)

Characteristics:

- discrete
- relational
- reversible in principle
